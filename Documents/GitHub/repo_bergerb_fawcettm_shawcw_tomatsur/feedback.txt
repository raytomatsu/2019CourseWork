Deliverable no.1

Part 3 looks good, with clear instructions.

The low grade is due to the readme missing a part 4. I expect you didn't finish part 4 because you were waiting for UDP. You shouldn't do this in a software development project â€“ instead you should make a small amount of correctly formatted data yourself, use that to help develop part 4, and then plug in the data from part 3 when it becomes available.

Code looks good (double for loop, priority queue).

Grade: 2.5/5 (subject to improvement, once you show me your simulation code is more developed)

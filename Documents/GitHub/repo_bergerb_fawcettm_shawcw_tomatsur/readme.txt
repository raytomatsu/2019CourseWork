3. Run the main.cpp file in the GenerateUDPMessages subproject. An activityLevels.txt is provided in the subproject folder, although you may need to move it to your build folder in order for the program to run. When the program is run, it will output UDP messages to the terminal window and to a file named "output.txt" in the build folder.



4. Run the main.cpp file in "ControlPackage." Large comments have been placed at the beginning and end of the proper lines of code (all else should be commented out). Print outs will be for:

The UDP number being processed (to monitor progress during a large computation --> when i % 100 == 0)

The time of events (entry/exit/peek)

The numbers of total events, entries, exits, and peeks

Perhaps the output.txt file will have to be moved to a certain build folder, is sometimes OS dependent
